- **CX2X XcodeML library**: An abstraction of a set of the XcodeML/F
intermediate representation that let the elements easily manipulable from Java

- **CX2X CLAW translator**: An XcodeML to XcodeML translator that implements the
CLAW language directive v0.1 (loop-fusion, loop-interchange, loop-extract,
remove)
- **CLAW Fortran Compiler driver**: the compiler driver that glue together all
pieces together for the full workflow.
