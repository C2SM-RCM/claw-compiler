\chapter{CLAW Compiler Configuration}
\label{chapter:configuration}

The different transformation enabled in the \clawfcomp and their order of 
application is configurable in the \clawfcomp global configuration file. The
available transformation are defined in transformation set files (see 
Section~\ref{section:conf_trans_set}.

\section{Transformation Set}
\label{section:conf_trans_set}
A transformation set is a group of transformations that are packed together and
that can be used during the translation. Each transformation set must be
described in a transformation set configuration file once. 
Listing~\ref{lst:internal_set_conf} shows the transformation set
configuration file for the CLAW internal transformation set.

    language=XML
  ]{code/claw-internal-set.xml}

A transformation set configuration file defines several characteristics of a
transformation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{name}: A unique name given to the transformation. This name is 
        used when defining the application order of the transformations.
  \item \textbf{type}: Type of the transformation as describe in 
        Section~\ref{section:trans_type}. Only two values are possible
        \lstinline|dependent| or \lstinline|independent|.
  \item \textbf{trigger}: How the transformation is triggered as described in 
        Section~\ref{section:trans_trigger}. Only two values are possible
        \lstinline|directive| or \lstinline|translation_unit|.
  \item \textbf{class}: Fully qualified class name implementing the 
        transformation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{External Transformation Set}
External transformation set can be implemented and their transformation applied
with the \clawfcomp. Section~\ref{section:new_trans} explains in detail how to
create and plus externals transformation and transformation sets. 

The transformation set configuration file for an external set must specify the
name of the JAR file containing the transformation classes in the 
\lstinline|transformations| element as shown in 
Figure~\ref{lst:external_set_conf}.

    caption=External transformation set configuration file,
    language=XML
  ]{code/external-set.xml}
  
\subsection{Location of external transformation sets JARs}
The JAR files specified in external transformation sets can be located anywhere
on disk. These location have to be set in the \lstinline!CLAW_TRANS_SET_PATH!
environment variable.
Several paths can be provided and they must be separated by \lstinline!:!.


\section{\clawfcomp Global Configuration}
The global configuration gives information about which transformation sets are
used, which transformation are enabled, in which order the transformations are
applied and several configuration key-value pair that can be accessed by the 
transformations. 

The configuration is separated in different sections: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{global}: this section encapsulate several key-value pair 
      configuration parameter. The attribute \lstinline!type! of the global
      section defines if the configuration is a root configuration or an 
      extension of the default one. User can overwrite partially or entirely
      the default configuration.
      The only mandatory key-value pair in the global section is the 
      \lstinline!translator! key.
\item \textbf{sets}: this section defines which transformation sets are used.
      The name corresponds to the filename of the transformation set 
      configuration file without extension.
\item \textbf{groups}: this section defines which transformations are enabled.
      The name corresponds to the name defined in each transformation set 
      configuration file.
      Only transformations part of the used transformation sets can be defined
      here.
      The order is defined by the order of declaration from top to bottom.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Default Configuration}

\subsection{User Defined Configuration}
Listing~\ref{lst:external_config} is an example of an user configuration that
can be passed to the \clawfcomp. It uses one transformation set and enable
one transformation. The transformation set is the one described in 
Listing~\ref{lst:external_set_conf}. This configuration will overwrite 
entirely the default configuration as its \lstinline!type! is \lstinline!root!.

    caption=Example of user root configuration,
    language=XML
  ]{code/external_config.xml}

Listing~\ref{lst:extension_config} is an example of a user extension 
configuration. Extension configuration overwrite only partially the default 
configuration. In this example, only the \lstinline!groups! element is 
overwritten with this new order of available transformation.
