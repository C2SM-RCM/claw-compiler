### CLAW Directive language specifications
The directives that control the transformation flow are defined in the
CLAW directive language specification.

[CLAW language definition](https://github.com/C2SM-RCM/claw-language-definition)

### Status of implementation
We are currently implementing the version `v0.3a` of the CLAW language
specification in this reference compiler.

### Versioning convention
The versioning convention for the CLAW Compiler follows the versioning of the
language definition. Version `0.1.0` implements the language specification
`v0.1`. If there is bug fix or enhancement happening in the version implementing
`v0.1` of the language specification, the last digit is incremented (e.g.
`0.1.1`) and so on. During implementation of new specifications, the version
number is followed by the letter `a` for the alphas and `b`for the betas.

### Compiler workflow
The diagram below shows the workflow of the CLAW Compiler.
![CLAW Compiler workflow](resource/clawfc_workflow.png)

##### Key components:
* **FPP**: standard preprocessor.
* **F_Front**: Fortran front-end. Convert Fortran program into an intermediate
representation.
* **cx2x**: CLAW intermediate representation translator.
* **om-f-back**: Fortran back-end. Generates Fortran code from intermediate
representation.

### How to install
See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) file.

### Documentation
To generate the java documentation and the compiler documentation, run the
following command. The compiler documentation require `pdflatex`.

The compiler documentation is generated in the `/documentation` directory, the
developer's guide is generated in the `/documentation/developer` directory and
the `javadoc` is generated in the `/documentation/javadoc/` directory.

```bash
make doc
```

### Supported version
The CLAW XcodeML to XcodeML translator is written in Java. Java version 7 and
above are supported.


### OMNI Compiler
The CLAW Compiler is built on the top of the OMNI Compiler. For more
